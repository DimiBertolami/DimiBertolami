### To whom this may concern 


âœ¨âœ¨

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp @ Becode AntwerpðŸ‘‹.
      In case you are wondering what exactly is the difference between regular school and a bootcamp? Well the difference for me is that in school you get the books, and you study until you can apply said knowledge. In a bootcamp we learn through excercises instead of books. This for me (which is a personal opinion) is a much faster way of understanding and applying these concepts.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m at the moment as a side project coding a Becode DrumMachine in Javascript, HTML and CSS but I'm not limiting myself to these only, I'm also investigating various front-end frameworks and libraries through-out this learning experience.
- ðŸ’¬ feel free to ask me anything!
