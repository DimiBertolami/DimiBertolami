### To whom this may concern 


âœ¨âœ¨

- ðŸŒ± I completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp @ Becode in AntwerpðŸ‘‹. After this course i was lucky to find a good company where i did an internship of 3 months. Here I was introduced in .NET using csharp as main language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m at the moment building a few apps that hopefully you find interesting. The first app is an automated Windows boot disk editor. It can open up a windows PE disk, edit it and reseal it back by simply pushing a few buttons.
- ðŸ’¬ Another app i'm building is a utility that acts as a front-end for distrowatch.org and at the moment it can download about 70 different distributions(versions) of linux install iso's and boot these iso's directly in a virtual machine.
