### To whom this may concern ðŸ‘‹


âœ¨âœ¨

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp @ Becode Antwerp.
      In case you are wondering what exactly is the difference between a regular school and a bootcamp? Well the difference
      is that in school you get the books, and you study until you can apply said knowledge. In a bootcamp we learn through
      excercises instead of books. This for me (=personal opinion) is a much faster way of understanding and applying these 
      concepts.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m at the moment as a side project coding a Becode DrumMachine in Javascript, HTML and CSS but I'm not limiting myself 
      to these basics, I'm also investigating various front-end frameworks and libraries through-out this learning
      experience.
- ðŸ’¬ feel free to ask me anything! I may not know everything but I will always at least try to be of assistance.
